        <h3>Understanding when to use "good" and "well".</h3>
        <a href="https://data.grammarbook.com/blog/adjectives-adverbs/good-v-well/"<h4>by Jane Straus</h4></a>
       
        <p><i>Good </i>is an adjective while <i>well</i> is an adverb answering the question <i>how</i>. 
            Sometimes well also functions as an adjective pertianing to health.</p>
        <p><strong>Examples</strong><br>
            <i>You did</i> a good job.<br>
            <i>Good</i> describes <i>job</i>, which is a noun, so good is the adjective<br></p>
            
            <p><i>You did the job</i> well.<br>
            <i>Well</i> is an adverb describing how the job was preformed</p>
            
            <p><i>I feel</i> well.<br>
            <i>Well</i> is an adjective describing I</p>

        <p><strong>Rule:</strong> With the four senses &mdash; <i>look, smell, taste, feel</i> &mdash; discern if these words are being used actively 
            to decide whethter to follow them with <i>good</i> or <i>well.</i> (<i>Hear</i> is always used actively.)</p>
        
        <p><strong>Examples:</strong><br>
        <i>You smell</i> good today.<br>
        <i>ood</i>G describe <i>you</i>, not thow you sniff with your nose.</p>

        <p><i>You smell</i> well for someone with a <i>cold.</i><br>
        You are sniffing actively with your nose here os use the adverb.</p>
        
        <p><i>She looks</i> good for a <i>75-year-old grandmother.</i><br>
        She is not looking actively with eyese so use the adjective.</p>

        <p><strong>Rule:</strong> when referring to health always use <i>well</i></p>
        <p><i>I do not feel</i> well <i>today.</i> <br>
        <i>You do not look</i> well.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rule:</strong> When describing someone;s emotional state, use <i>good.</i> <br>
        <strong>Example:</strong> <i>He doesn't feel</i> good <i>about having cheated</i></p>

        <p>So,when you answer the question,"How are you?" if you think someone is asking about your phyical well-being, answer, 
            "I feel <i>well</i>," or "I don't feel <i>well</i>." If someone is asking about your emotional state, 
            answer, "I feel <i>good</i>," or "I don't feel <i>good</i>."</p>

        <h3>See the distinction?</h3>
