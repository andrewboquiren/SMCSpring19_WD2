        <h2>Good vs. Well</h2>
        <p>Good is an adjective while well is an adverb answering the question how. 
            Sometimes well also functions as an adjective pertianing to health.</p>
        <p>Examples:<br>
            You did a good job.<br>
            Good describes job, which is a noun, so good is the adjective<br></p>
            <p>You did the job well.<br>
            Well is an adverb describing how the job was preformed</p>
            <p>I feel well.<br>
                Well is an adjective describing I</p>
        <p>Rule: With the four senses â€“ look, smell, taste, feel- discern if these words are being used actively 
            to decide whethter to follow them with good or well. (Hear is always used actively.)</p>
        <p>Examples:<br>
        You smell good today.<br>
        Good describe you, not thow you sniff with your nose.</p>

        <p>You smell well for someone with a cold.<br>
        You are sniffing actively with your nose here os use the adverb.</p>
        <p>She looks good for a 75-year-old grandmother.<br>
        She is not looking actively with eyese so use the adjective.</p>

        <p>Rule: when referring to health always use well</p>
        <p>I do not feel well today. <br>
        You do not look well</p>
        <p>Rule: When describing someone;s emotional state, use good. <br>
        Example: He doesn't feel good about having cheated</p>

        <p>So,when you answer the question,"How are you?" if you think someone is asking about your phyical well[being, answer, 
            "I feel well," or "I don't feel well." If someone is asking about your emotional state, 
            answer, "I feel good," or "I don't feel good."</p>
